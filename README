A small + lightweight OS

filesystem/
    This directory contains the base filesystem files (excluding the ones
    generated by compiling the userspace programs).

kernel/
    This directory contains the kernel source code.

userspace/
    This directory contains the source code for the userspace programs.
    The lolibc subdirectory contains a custom libc implementation.

build.sh
    This script builds the entire project, including the kernel and all
    userspace programs. Run it with the optional "clean" argument to
    delete all object files. Run it with "run" to also boot QEMU after a
    successful build. The "-c" (compat) flag can be used to boot the
    original ECE 391 filesystem.

server.sh
    This script runs a TCP music streaming server. It takes the path to
    an audio file as an argument, converts it into WAV format, and serves
    it at port 7878 on the host. To download this within the VM, connect
    to 10.0.2.2:7878. ffmpeg is required to convert the file to WAV.
