A small + lightweight OS

filesystem/
    This directory contains the base filesystem files (excluding the ones
    generated by compiling the userspace programs).

kernel/
    This directory contains the kernel source code.

userspace/
    This directory contains the source code for the userspace programs.

build.sh
    This script builds the entire project, including the kernel and all
    userspace programs. Run it with the optional "clean" argument to
    delete all object files. Run it with "run" to also boot QEMU after a
    successful build.
