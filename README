A small + lightweight OS

This is a Linux-like x86 operating system built from scratch. It was
started as a class project for the ECE 391 course at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Since then, support for the following features
has been added (on top of the baseline assignment requirements):

- signals
- PS/2 mouse
- Tux controller (it's a ECE 391 thing)
- libc
- audio playback (Sound Blaster 16)
- (k)malloc
- networking (NE2000)
- fork, exec, wait
- pipes

Features that are NOT supported (but may be added in the future):

- GUI (or really, any graphics)
- ext2 filesystem
- ELF loader

Note that this is a Linux-like operating system, not a Linux-compatible
operating system. It is neither API nor ABI compatible with Linux, and
the userspace libc is obviously not standards-compliant either. It is,
however, ABI compatible with the ECE 391 specification, and can even boot
the original MP3 filesystem and pass all tests... well, maybe except for
style ;-)

To compile the OS, Linux is required. It compiles on both the ECE 391 VM
and on modern Linux systems - just run the build.sh script in the root
directory. GCC or Clang, -O0 through -O2, pick your poison! To add new
userspace programs to the filesystem, add the source code to the userspace
directory and they will automatically be compiled into the filesystem. For
static (non-code) files, just add them directly to the filesystem directory.
Note that the total size of this directory should not exceed ~3MB, or else
the OS will fail to boot.

Do not attempt to boot this OS on real hardware - it will almost certainly
not work, and might even set your computer on fire. QEMU is required to
boot the operating system - bochs has been tested to be working at one point
but is not officially supported.

Below is a short description of the source tree contents:

filesystem/
    This directory contains the base filesystem files (excluding the ones
    generated by compiling the userspace programs).

kernel/
    This directory contains the kernel source code.

userspace/
    This directory contains the source code for the userspace programs.
    The lolibc subdirectory contains a custom libc implementation.

build.sh
    This script builds the entire project, including the kernel and all
    userspace programs. Run it with the optional "clean" argument to
    delete all object files. Run it with "run" to also boot QEMU after a
    successful build. The "-c" (compat) flag can be used to boot the
    original ECE 391 filesystem.

server.sh
    This script runs a TCP music streaming server. It takes the path to
    an audio file as an argument, converts it into WAV format, and serves
    it at port 7878 on the host. To download this within the VM, connect
    to 10.0.2.2:7878. ffmpeg is required to convert the file to WAV.
