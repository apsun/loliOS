ECE391 MP3 - Package contents
================================

filesystem/
    This directory contains the base filesystem files (excluding the ones
    generated by compiling the userspace programs).

kernel/
    This directory contains the kernel source code.

userspace/
    This directory contains the source code for the userspace programs.
    The lolibc subdirectory contains a custom libc implementation.
    New C files added to this directory will automatically be compiled.

build.sh
    This script builds the entire project, including the kernel and all
    userspace programs. Run it with the optional "clean" argument to
    delete all object files. Run it with "run" to boot QEMU after a
    successful build.

createfs.py
    This program takes a flat source directory (i.e. no subdirectories
    in the source directory) and creates a filesystem image in the
    format specified for this MP.  Run it with no parameters to see
    usage.

elfconvert
    This program takes a 32-bit ELF (Executable and Linking Format) file
    - the standard executable type on Linux - and converts it to the
    executable format specified for this MP.  The output filename is
    <exename>.converted.
