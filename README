A small + lightweight OS


ECE391 MP3 - Package contents
================================

build.sh
    This script builds the entire project, including the kernel and all
    userspace programs.

createfs.py
    This program takes a flat source directory (i.e. no subdirectories
    in the source directory) and creates a filesystem image in the
    format specified for this MP.  Run it with no parameters to see
    usage.

elfconvert
    This program takes a 32-bit ELF (Executable and Linking Format) file
    - the standard executable type on Linux - and converts it to the
    executable format specified for this MP.  The output filename is
    <exename>.converted.

fsdir/
    This is the directory from which your filesystem image was created.
    It contains versions of cat, fish, grep, hello, ls, and shell, as
    well as the frame0.txt and frame1.txt files that fish needs to run.
    If you want to change files in your OS's filesystem, modify this
    directory and then run the "createfs" utility on it to create a new
    filesystem image.

README
    This file.

student-distrib/
    This is the directory that contains the source code for your
    operating system.  Currently, a skeleton is provided that will build
    and boot you into protected mode, printing out various boot
    parameters.  Read the INSTALL file in that directory for
    instructions on how to set up the bootloader to boot this OS.

syscalls/
    This directory contains a basic system call library that is used by
    the utility programs such as cat, grep, ls, etc.  The library
    provides a C interface to the system calls, much like the C library
    (libc) provides on a real Linux/Unix system.  A few support
    functions have also been written (things like strlen, strcpy, etc.)
    that are used by the utility programs.  The Makefile is set up to
    build these programs for your OS.
